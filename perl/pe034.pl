# Finds the sum of all numbers equal to the sum of the factorial of their
# digits. Numbers of this form are called factorions. It's worth noting that
# there are only four factorions: 1, 2, 145, and 40585. This pre-computes all
# factorials from 0 to 9, then determines the upper limit using
#   10 ^ (d - 1) <= n <= n * 9!
# where d is the number of digits and n is the number. Once d is found, the max
# value is given by d * 9!. Since we're looking for sums, the main loop starts
# at 10 and goes to the limit, calculating the sum and comparing.
