# Project Euler problem 25
# by Taylor Fausak

# Finds the first term in the Fibonacci sequence with 1000 digits. A number
# with n digits is greater than 10^(n-1). The nth Fibonacci number, F(n),
# is given by
#   F(n) = floor(phi^n / sqrt(5) + 1 / 2)
# Setting F(n) equal to 10^(d - 1), where d is the number of digits, and
# solving for n (ignoring the +1/2 term, since it just rounds) gives
#   n = ((d - 1) + log(5) / 2) / log(phi)
# where log(n) is the base-10 logarithm of n.
