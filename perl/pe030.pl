# Finds the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth
# powers of their digits. A number n is the sum of its digits raised to the
# power m iff
#   n = sum(1, k) di^m
# where k is the number of digits and di is the ith digit (d1 being the least
# significant and dk being the most significant). The upper bound for numbers of
# this form is given by (b is the base, which is 10 in this case)
#   k * (b - 1)^m = b^(k - 1)
# which cannot be solved explicitly for k. Using a calculator, k = 6.5, so we
# only need to check up k * (b - 1)^m or 6 * 9^5.
