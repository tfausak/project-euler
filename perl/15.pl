# Project Euler problem 15
# by Taylor Fausak

# Finds the number of routes (without backtracking) along the edges of a
# 20x20 grid. For an nxn grid, the number of routes is the center number of
# the (2n + 1)th row of Pascal's triangle. That value can be solved for
# iteratively using v(c) = (r - c) / c, with r = row and c = column.
