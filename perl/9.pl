# Project Euler problem 9
# by Taylor Fausak

# Finds the product abc of the Pythagorean triplet where a + b + c = 1000. For
# two numbers n and m, the following formulas produce a triplet if m > n
#   a = 2 * m * n
#   b = m^2 - n^2
#   c = m^2 + n^2
# and the product, abc, is given by
#   abc = (2 * m * n) * (m^4 - n^4)
